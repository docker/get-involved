Docker Captain is a distinction that Docker awards select members of the community that are both experts in their field and are passionate about sharing their Docker knowledge with others. Captains are Docker ambassadors (not employees) and their commitment to sharing their expertise has a huge impact on the Docker community – whether they are blogging, writing books, speaking, running workshops, creating tutorials and classes, offering support in forums, or organizing and contributing to local events – they help make Docker’s mission of democratizing technology possible.

This program is designed to foster Docker advocates and promote the creation of high-value content by connecting program members with Docker engineering and marketing resources. Program participants will be established as high-profile community leaders to inspire and educate the Docker community.

**Membership into this program is based on:**

* Recommendation by Docker employee
* Demonstrated competence in Docker technology
* Being a positive presence in the tech community and ecosystem

**Benefits of the Docker Captains program include:**

* Briefings prior to product updates and other announcements with Docker engineers and special guests
* Ability to list program membership on personal profiles
* Promotion of relevant content created by members through Docker’s social channels 
  * also curated in content collections and distributions like Docker Weekly
* Access to conversations with Docker staff as-needed

**What can you expect?**

You will receive email invitations to join briefings with other Docker Captains. The topics range from product briefings to technical deep dives with plenty of time for questions at the end. These briefings are usually one hour long and are scheduled on average every two weeks. Each briefing is recorded and shared with the program members after being held.

* Abide by the [Docker Captains’ Code of Conduct](../blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
* Participate in program events and activities
* Create and share content covering the Docker platform and ecosystem
* Provide us with feedback on the program, product, betas, etc.
