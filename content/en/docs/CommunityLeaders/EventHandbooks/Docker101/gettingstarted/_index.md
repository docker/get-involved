## Running Hello World Example



```
$ docker run hello-world

```

```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:31b9c7d48790f0d8c50ab433d9c3b7e17666d6993084c002c2ff1ca09b96391d
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

<!-- 
## Troubleshooting
  ```
$ docker run hello-world
```
```
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/create": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.
See 'docker run --help'.
```


## Add "sudo" Before Run Any Docker Command 
Example :-
```
$ sudo docker run hello-world
````

```
[sudo] password for mansi: 
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

### Manage Docker as a non-root user

The Docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. The Docker daemon always runs as the root user.If you don’t want to preface the docker command with sudo, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group.

## To run Docker without root privileges

To create the docker group and add your user:

 ### Create the docker group.
    
```
 sudo groupadd docker
```
## Add your user to the docker group.
```
 sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

## Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated.

If testing on a virtual machine, it may be necessary to restart the virtual machine for changes to take effect.

On a desktop Linux environment such as X Windows, log out of your session completely and then log back in.

On Linux, you can also run the following command to activate the changes to groups:

 newgrp docker 

## Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo.
```
 docker run hello-world
```
This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a message and exits.

If you initially ran Docker CLI commands using sudo before adding your user to the docker group, you may see the following error, which indicates that your ~/.docker/ directory was created with incorrect permissions due to the sudo commands.
```
WARNING: Error loading config file: /home/user/.docker/config.json -
stat /home/user/.docker/config.json: permission denied
```
To fix this problem, either remove the ~/.docker/ directory (it is recreated automatically, but any custom settings are lost), or change its ownership and permissions using the following commands:

```
 sudo chown "$USER":"$USER" /home/"$USER"/.docker -R

 sudo chmod g+rwx "$HOME/.docker" -R
```


### Explanation


This image is a prime example of using the scratch image effectively. See hello.c in https://github.com/docker-library/hello-world for the source code of the hello binary included in this image.

So what’s happened here? We’ve called the docker run command, which is responsible for launching containers.

The argument hello-world is the name of the image someone created on dockerhub for us. It will first search for "hello-world" image locally and then search in Dockerhub.

Once the image has been downloaded, Docker turns the image into a running container and executes it. 

### Did you Know?

1. The Hello World Docker Image is only 1.84 KB size.

```
[node1] (local) root@192.168.0.18 ~
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world         latest              4ab4c602aa5e        6 weeks ago         1.84kB
```

2. While running `docker ps` command, it doesn't display any running container. Reason - It gets executed once and exit immediately.

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS
      PORTS               NAMES
```

3. You can use `docker inspect <imagename>` command to inspect about this particular Docker Image. 

```
$ docker inspect 4ab

  </tr>
  
</table>

### Pre-requisite

- Create an account with [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com)
- Open [PWD](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) Platform on your browser 
- Click on **Add New Instance** on the left side of the screen to bring up Alpine OS instance on the right side


### Listing the Docker Images

```
$ docker images
```

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world         latest              4ab4c602aa5e        6 weeks ago         1.84kB
```

### Show all images (default hides intermediate images)

```
docker images -a
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world         latest              4ab4c602aa5e        6 weeks ago         1.84kB
```


### List images by name and tag

The docker images command takes an optional [REPOSITORY[:TAG]] argument that restricts the list to images that match the argument. If you specify REPOSITORY but no TAG, the docker images command lists all images in the given repository.

To demo this, let us pull all various versions of alpine OS

```
docker pull alpine:3.6
docker pull alpine:3.7
docker pull alpine:3.8
docker pull alpine:3.9
```

```

### Listing out images with filter

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

```

If you want to filter out just alpine

```
$ docker images --filter=reference='alpine'
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

### Saving Images and Containers as Tar Files for Sharing

Imagine a scenario where you have built Docker images and containers that you would be interested to keep and share it with your other collaborators or colleagues. The below methods shall help you achieve it.

Four basic Docker CLI comes into action:

- The `docker export` - Export a container’s filesystem as a tar archive
- The `docker import` - Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image
- The `docker save` - Save one or more images to a tar archive (streamed to STDOUT by default)
- The `docker load` - Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN

### Create Nginx Container

```
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
Unable to find image 'nginx:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/nginx
a5a6f2f73cd8: Pull complete
1ba02017c4b2: Pull complete

[node1] (local) root@192.168.0.33 ~
```

### Displaying Running Container
```
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES

```


```
$ docker export df2 > nginx.tar
```

You could commit this container as a new image  locally, but you could also use the Docker import command:

```
$ docker import - mynginx < nginx.tar
sha256:aaaed50d250a671042e8dc383c6e05012e245f5eaf555d10c40be63f6028ee7b
```

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
mynginx             latest              aaaed50d250a        25 seconds ago      107MB
nginx               latest              568c4670fa80        2 weeks ago         109MB
```


If you wanted to share this image with one of your collaborators, you could upload the tar file on a web server and let your collaborator download it and use the import command on his Docker host.

If you would rather deal with images that you have already committed, you can use the load and save commands:

```
$ docker save -o mynginx1.tar nginx
```

```
$ ls -l
total 218756
-rw-------    1 root     root     112844800 Dec 18 02:53 mynginx1.tar
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root     111158784 Dec 18 02:50 nginx.tar
```

```
$ docker rmi mynginx
Untagged: mynginx:latest
Deleted: sha256:aaaed50d250a671042e8dc383c6e05012e245f5eaf555d10c40be63f6028ee7b

```

Now delete all images and containers running and try to run the below command to load Docker image into your system:

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
```

```
$ docker load < mynginx1.tar
Loaded image: nginx:latest
```

```
[node1] (local) root@192.168.0.33 ~$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

</table>

### Pre-requisite

- Create an account with [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com)
- Open [PWD](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) Platform on your browser 
- Click on **Add New Instance** on the left side of the screen to bring up Alpine OS instance on the right side

Under this tutorial we will see how to build our own first alpine based Docker Image.

```
$ docker run -dit alpine sh
620e1bcb5ab6e84b75a7a5c35790a77691112e59830ea1d5d85244bc108578c9

### Updating APK Packages

```
/ # apk update

```

### Now lets come out of it by Ctrl+P+Q and commit the changes

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

```

There you see a new image just created.

### Time to tag the image

```
$ docker tag --help

Usage:  docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]

Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE
[node4] (local) root@192.168.0.20 ~
$ docker tag ajeetraina/alpine-git:latest ajeetraina/alpine-git:1.0
```

```
$ docker images
